	<p>Stray animal shelter was established in 2003. The shelter was founded due to extremely difficult conditions of stray animals in Georgia. Cleaning service of Tbilisi City Hall was responsible for dealing with stray animals. The responsibility was later transferred to infrastructure service. No shelter or humane program of controlling stray animal population was in place. The mentioned services and their contractors were directly eliminating stray animals using inhumane methods, which in addition to being cruel, were inefficient in regulating stray animal population. With the aim to deal with the situation a non-commercial legal entity â€“ NGO Georgia Society for the Protection and Safety of Animals was established. Animal shelter became structural unit of the organization.</p>
